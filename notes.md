# Notes (or maybe FAQ)

## Ways of obtaining pokemon

The following methods of obtaining pokemon are documented and used:
+ Evolution
+ Wild encounters
+ Trainer battles (See next section for pokemon depending on your starter choice)

The following methods are documented but not used (due to the long time they require):
+ Honey trees
+ Fossiles
+ In-game trades

The following methods are not even documented:
+ Breeding
+ Whichever else I have forgotten exists hehe...

## What *depends.json* is
There are some pokemon that you either see or not depending on your starter. Those are:
+ The three evolutions of your starter.
+ The three evolutions of the rival's starter.
+ Ponyta-Rapidash, Buizel-Floatzel and Roselia-Roserade on rival fights as well.
+ Professor's assistant Lucas/Dawn's starter (just the first evolution is a must).

More pokemon I have added because I didn't want to add them in other places:
+ The rest of the rival's pokemon.
+ Munchlax and Clefairy, they are the first pokemon they use when you coop with the rival and Prof's assistant (respectively) in double battles.
+ Dialga. Why? Because of laziness.


## Why choose Chimchar as starter?
Choosing either Chimchar or Piplup will not change which pokemon you will necessarily see. If you choose Turtwig, you will have to take an extra battle to see Prinplup.
