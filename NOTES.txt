Ways to obtain pokemon not used but documented:
	Honey trees
	Fossiles
	In-game trades



NOTES:

	* Scrolling through the professor's bag doesnt register starters.

	* Catching tutorial does not add third starter to dex.

	* Coop fights (Lucas/Dawn, Rival, Cheryl and Riley) register their pokemon.
		- Although they may use more, only the first is registered obligatorily.
		- The firsties of Cheryl and Lucas/Dawn apart from the third starter (Clefairy) and Rival (Munchlax) are added in depends. Also Dialga. Why? Because.

	* Pshychic Abigail (Route 214) is set to must because otherwise another trainer in route 212 would be and Abigail is better. Prove me wrong.

	* Galactic Grunts 30 and 31 in Galactic HQ: One of either has to be fought. They have no unique must pokemon.

	* Golbat outside Mt. Coronet Summit only appears at night, but I didnt wanna complicate info.



NOTES ON ROUTE:

	* Turtwig sucks because you need to go to Route 212 to see Prinplup. Chimchar and Piplup have the same pokemon to see, 1 less than Turtwig.
